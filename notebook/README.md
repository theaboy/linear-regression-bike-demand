This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used for the project.

The notebook documents the full experimental workflow, including:
- data loading and preprocessing
- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- implementation of linear regression using the analytical solution
- model evaluation
- non-linear feature engineering
- analysis and discussion

## Contents

This is the **main notebook** for the project. It is structured according to the following tasks:

1. **Task 1 – Data Acquisition & Exploration**
   - Loading the Bike Sharing dataset
   - Inspecting features and data types
   - Cleaning and preprocessing
   - Exploratory visualizations

2. **Task 2 – Linear Regression (Analytical Solution)**
   - Construction of the design matrix (with bias term)
   - Closed-form solution using `numpy.linalg.lstsq`
   - Train/test split
   - Evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Model performance visualizations

3. **Task 3 – Non-linear Feature Engineering**
   - Addition of polynomial and interaction features
   - Retraining and comparison of training error

4. **Task 4 – Analysis & Discussion**
   - Interpretation of results
   - Limitations of linear regression
   - Effect of feature engineering
