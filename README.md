# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction using Linear Regression
 
The goal of the project is to apply **linear regression (from scratch)** to a real-world dataset and study the impact of **data preprocessing and feature engineering**.

---

## Project Overview

We use the **UCI Bike Sharing Dataset (daily aggregated data)** to predict the total number of rented bikes per day (`cnt`) using linear regression.

The project focuses on:
- Understanding and preprocessing real-world data
- Implementing linear regression using the **closed-form solution**
- Exploring **non-linear feature engineering**
- Evaluating model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
